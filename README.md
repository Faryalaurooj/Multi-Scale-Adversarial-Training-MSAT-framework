# Multi-Scale Adversarial Training (MSAT) Framework

This repository contains the **Multi-Scale Adversarial Training (MSAT)** framework, designed to enhance object detection in remote sensing applications. It combines synthetic and real-world data using SinGAN-based realistic augmentation and incorporates a Multi-Scale Attention (MSA) mechanism for improved model performance.

## Features

- **SinGAN-based Realistic Augmentation**: Uses SinGAN to generate realistic augmentations for training.
- **Realism Discriminator**: A discriminator designed to ensure the realism of the generated data.
- **Multi-Scale Attention (MSA)**: Attention mechanism for enhancing feature relevance across scales.
- **Support for Hybrid Datasets**: Compatible with both synthetic and real datasets.
- **Evaluation on Multiple Real-World Datasets**: Provides evaluation results on various datasets for performance analysis.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.6 or later
- `pip` (Python package manager)

Instructions to Install Dependencies

To install all the dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file, follow these steps:

    Clone the repository (if you haven't done so already):

`git clone https://github.com/your-username/MSAT-Framework.git`
`cd MSAT-Framework`

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

`python3 -m venv venv`

Activate the virtual environment:

    On macOS/Linux:

`source venv/bin/activate`

On Windows:

  `  venv\Scripts\activate`

Install dependencies from the requirements.txt:

   ` pip install -r requirements.txt`

This will install all the required libraries specified in requirements.txt into your virtual environment.

### Configuration

Before running the framework, ensure that the config.yaml file is properly configured to match your dataset paths and model parameters.
Usage
Running the Framework

## Train
To train and evaluate the MSAT framework, simply run the main script:

`python main.py`

This will initiate the training process with the synthetic and real datasets, applying the multi-scale attention mechanism and realism discriminator.
Training the GAN

If you want to train the SinGAN generator separately, use the following command:

`python train_gan.py`

This script will generate synthetic samples that can be used for training the object detection model.
Data Format

    Real Datasets: Store your real-world images in the data/real/ directory.

    Synthetic Datasets: Store your synthetic data in the data/synthetic/ directory.

## Output

The generated samples will be saved in the outputs/generated_samples/ directory, where you can inspect the synthetic images generated by the SinGAN.
