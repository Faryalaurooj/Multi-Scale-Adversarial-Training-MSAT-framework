# Multi-Scale-Adversarial-Training-MSAT-framework
we introduce a Multi-Scale Adversarial Train- ing (MSAT) framework that bridges the gap between synthetic and real satellite imagery, improving object detection robustness. Our approach focuses on enhanc- ing detection performance in scenarios with limited annotated aerial data by generating high-fidelity synthetic samples.
